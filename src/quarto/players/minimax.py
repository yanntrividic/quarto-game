    game_state -- a tuple of three elements :
        - [0] the game_board, a Board object that holds the current played pieces
        - [1] the storage_board, a Board object that holds the pieces available to pick
        - [2] the selected_piece coordinates, a tuple of (x, y) coordinates that correspond to an available piece
        on the storage_board. This is the piece that has to be put on the game_board.
    depth -- int that represents the maximum depth we will explore
    max_player -- the player trying to maximize its evaluation, True if maximizing, False if minimizing

    Returns
    a tuple that contains :
    [0] the evaluation of the move (between -9 for a loss, and 9 for a win)
    [1] the new game_state
