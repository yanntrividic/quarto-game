**Description**  
This program is a Python implementation of the board game *Quarto!* with an artificial intelligence based on the minimax algorithm. This program is partly based on the work of Mohrmann et al. (2013) and on the video tutorial of the YouTube channel *Tech with Tim*. This project was developed in the context of Elise Bonzon's Artificial Intelligence course at the Université de Paris.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a Python3.x version installed on your computer with the `pygame` module. You can install `pygame` by running one of the following commands:

    pip install pygame  
    pip3 install pygame  
    python3.x -m pip install pygame  

You will need to replace the `x` by your Python version number.

After filling this requirement, you can start the program by opening a terminal in the `src` folder and run:

    python play.py  
    python3.x play.py  

The last command is needed if your default version is not a 3.x version. 
You will need to replace the `x` by your Python version number.
