    Implementation of the minimax algorithm (negamax variant) with alpha-beta pruning for Quarto! based on
     * https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Checkers-AI/blob/master/minimax/algorithm.py
     * https://github.com/marienfressinaud/AI_quarto

    game_state -- a tuple of three elements :
        - [0] the game_board, a Board object that holds the current played pieces
        - [1] the storage_board, a Board object that holds the pieces available to pick
        - [2] the selected_piece coordinates, a tuple of (x, y) coordinates that correspond to an available piece
        on the storage_board. This is the piece that has to be put on the game_board.
    depth -- int that represents the maximum depth we will explore
    max_player -- the player trying to maximize its evaluation, True if maximizing, False if minimizing
    alpha -- initialized to the worst possible evaluation, has to be None if we don&#39;t want any pruning
    beta -- initialized to the best possible evaluation, has to be None if we don&#39;t want any pruning
    verbose -- if you want to see the different states being evaluated

    Returns
    a tuple that contains :
    [0] the evaluation of the child (between -9 for a loss, and 9 for a win)
    [1] the new game_state

def state_eval(game_state):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;
    Computes the evaluation of the state of the game. The value can range from 0 (a draw) to 9 (a win)
    1 signifies that there is no win opportunity for the player that is gonna play next, whereas 8 means
    that there is 7 win opportunities (the maximum you can get)

    Heuristic function for the level 3 and 4 AIs. The return values can range from 0 to 7 depending on the number
